	<p>(born 22 November 1965) is a Danish actor. Originally a gymnast and dancer, he began acting in 1996.<br> 
	He rose to fame in Denmark as Tonny the drug dealer in the first two films of the Pusher film trilogy, and in<br> 
	his role as the brash yet sensitive policeman, Allan Fischer, in Peter Thorsboe's Danish television series Rejseholdet<br> 
	(Unit One) (2000–03).</p>

	<p>Mikkelsen became more widely known for his role as Tristan in Jerry Bruckheimer's production King Arthur (2004), but achieved<br> 
	worldwide recognition for playing the main antagonist Le Chiffre in the twenty-first James Bond film, Casino Royale (2006). <br>
	He has since become known for his roles as Igor Stravinsky in Jan Kounen's French film Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky (2008) <br>
	and his Cannes Film Festival Best Actor Award-winning role as Lucas in the 2012 Danish film The Hunt.</p>

	<p>A. O. Scott of The New York Times remarked that in the Hollywood scene, Mikkelsen has "become a reliable character actor with an intriguing mug"<br>
	but stated that on the domestic front <q>he is something else: a star, an axiom, a face of the resurgent Danish cinema.</q></p>

			<p>Mikkelsen was born in Østerbro, Copenhagen, the second son of Bente Christiansen, a nurse, and Henning Mikkelsen,<br>
			a bank teller and trade union official. He and his older brother, Lars Mikkelsen, who is also an actor, were raised in Nørrebro.<br>
			In his youth, he trained as a gymnast, wanting to pursue athletics, but then studied dancing at the Balettakademien (ballet academy)<br> 
			in Gothenburg where he also became fluent in Swedish.[6] During his dancing career, Mikkelsen met choreographer Hanne Jacobsen,<br> 
			whom he married in 2000. He was a professional dancer for almost a decade until he left it behind to study drama at the Århus Theatre School in 1996,<br> 
			embarking on a career in acting</p>
